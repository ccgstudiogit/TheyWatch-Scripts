# Development Reflection

Over the course of developing this project, I significantly improved my understanding of Unity's workflow as well as software architecture and design principles.
Many systems that I created were refactored mid-development as I continued to learn about patterns, styles, and architecture. After completing this project, I now have
a stronger foundation in writing scalable code and have a better idea of what patterns to use and where.

Moving forward, I plan to place a greater emphasis on scalability, reusability, and debuggability from the start. Working through They Watch helped highlight areas
where earlier decisions created unncessary complexity, and those experiences helped to change how I intend to approach future projects with cleaner structure and
more intentional design.
