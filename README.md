# TheyWatch-Scripts
These are the scripts for my first published game, They Watch. These scripts are provided for portfolio and educational review.

# Development Reflection
Over the course of developing this project, I significantly improved my understanding of Unity's workflow as well as software architecture and design principles. Many
of the systems I created--player interactions, inventory management, enemy AI, scene loading, input handling, and more--went through multiple refactors as I continued to
learn about architecture patterns, event-driven design, and separation of responsibilities mid-project. Through this process, I became much more comfortable with concepts
like inheritance, composition, interfaces, state machines, and C# events.

This project was also much, much bigger in scope than my previous projects, which led me to handling challenges such as managing cross-scene communication, handling player
data, organizing a large number of scripts, and structuring gameplay logic in a way that remainded stable throughout feature additions. Although programming was the primary
focus, this is also the first project where I created the majority of assets myself (3D models, animations, and some sound effects/music). Doing everything myself gave me a
better understanding of how art, audio, and code fit together into a cohesive experience and also taught me to make sure that my systems are flexible, as things can and will
inevitably change.

Moving forward, I plan to place an even greater emphasis on scalability, reusability, and debuggability from the very beginning of development. Working through They Watch
helped highlight areas where earlier decisions created unncessary complexity, and these lessons will help me approach future projects with a cleaner and more deliberate
structure.
